The goal of this project is to produce a slideshow framework in HTML
5; this framework should completely replace the need for LaTeX's
Beamer package. In particular, we will allow typesetting of LaTeX
formula via Mathjax, and animations and slide transitions using D3.js.

- Mathjax: rendering LaTeX with Javascript
- D3.js: Data-driven Documents, a framework for manipulating HTML 5
  pages (including SVG images) based on data
